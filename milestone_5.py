        This function checks if the players guessed letter is in the randomly generated word.

        This function processes a player's guess by converting it to lowercase and checking if it
        is present in the word to be guessed. If the guess is correct, it updates the word_guessed 
        list to reveal the guessed letters and decreases the count of remaining unique letters by
        1. If the guess is incorrect, it decreases the players number of lives by 1.

        provied. It validates the input to ensure it is an input that hasn't been guessed 
        before. If the guess is valid, it updates the list of guesses and checks if the 
        guess is in the word using the check_guess() method.
